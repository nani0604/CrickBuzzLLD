Cricbuzz LLD
This repository contains the Low-Level Design (LLD) of a cricket score tracking system inspired by Cricbuzz. The focus is on building scalable, maintainable object-oriented models and demonstrating solid software design principles.

✅ Project Overview
I have implemented the Cricbuzz Low-Level Design (LLD) covering core components such as:

Match Types (ODI, T20, Test Matches)

Teams, Players, and Squads

Scoreboard Management

Overs, Balls, Runs, Wickets

Commentaries and Match Events

The primary aim of this project is to showcase my understanding of:

Object-Oriented Design Principles

SOLID Principles

Design Patterns relevant to system design

Clean Code Practices

✅ Technologies Used
Java (or replace with Python/C++ based on your implementation)

UML Diagrams (if applicable)

Basic Console-based simulation (optional)

✅ How to Run (If applicable)
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cricbuzz-lld.git
cd cricbuzz-lld
# Run your main application file here
✅ What I Learned
End-to-end modeling of real-world systems

Thought process behind scalable architecture

Applying OOP concepts like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation
